# Test Contract
The Test contract is an example Solidity smart contract that implements a simple unsigned integer variable and a few functions for interacting with it. The contract includes a setter function, a getter function, an add function, and a revert function.

## Getting Started
To use the Test contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and a Solidity development environment, such as Remix or Truffle.

## Installation
To deploy the Test contract, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Test.sol file in Remix or your preferred Solidity development environment.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or Truffle, or a similar tool.
Interact with the contract using a web3 interface, such as MyEtherWallet or MetaMask.

## Usage
The Test contract has the following public functions:

setValue(uint256 _value)
Assigns an integer to the variable "value". The input value must be greater than 0, as the require statement checks for this condition.

getValue()
Returns the current value of the value variable.

add(uint256 a, uint256 b)
Adds the integer values a and b together and returns the added value.

revert()
Always reverts with the specified error message using the revert() statement.
